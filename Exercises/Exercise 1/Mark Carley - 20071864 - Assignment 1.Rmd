# Section 1 - Histograms

 * A __Histogram__ is a type of bar-chart where the categories are number intervals as opposed to nominal categories.


 * In this section we are going to use __R__ to plot a histogram for a given data set. 
 
 * During lectures we will find that there is a certain amount of ambiguity in how we graph a histogram, in that the number of bars    and consequently the bar-widths are not fixed, but can be chosen. 
 
However we do have some guidelines to help us:

### Guidelines for Histograms

1. The number of bars should be between __5__ and __20__.

2. If the lowest and highest data points are __not convenient numbers__ then we can do the following:
    
    * __Round down__ the smallest data point to the next lowest convenient number.
    
    * __Round up__ the largest data point toe the next highest convenient number.
    
3. Find the __length__ (or __range__) of this new interval by subtracting the lowest from the highest data values.

4. If possible, choose the number of bars such that this number divides evenly into the __range__, to give us our __interval__.


5. Starting with the smallest value, start marking off the horizontal axis in units of the interval, until the highest data point is reached.

6. Categorise the data into theses intervals and construct a  frequency (or relative frequency) table for this categorization
  
 * __NOTE:__ If a data value falls within two consecutive intervals, place it in the __upper interval__.  
  
7. The height of each bar on the histogram corresponds to the frequency or relative frequency of the interval.

### Example 1

The trees in an orchard were measured and found to have the following heights

* 3.4m, 3.5m, 3.7m, 4.2m, 4.4m, 4.7m, 4.9m, 5.1m, 5.2m, 5.3m, 5.9m, 6.0m, 6.4m, 7.3m, 7.9m, 8.1m, 8.7m.

Construct a histogram to graph this data set.

### Solution 
1. We may __round off__ the highest and lowest values to more convenient numbers such as
  * __3.4 $\to$ 3__.
  * __8.7 $\to$ 9__.
2. The new data __range__ is given by __range__=9-3=6
3. We choose a number between __5__ and __20__ which __divides__ evenly into this __range__, and so an obvious choice is __6 bars__ for this histogram.
4. We create a __vector__ valued object to store the measured heights: 

```{r}
Heights <- c(3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.9, 6.0, 6.4, 7.3, 7.9, 8.1, 8.7)
```

5. We use the __hist()__ function to plot a histogram of the vector __Heights__

```{r}
hist(Heights, breaks=6, axes=T,col="skyblue4", main="Histogram of Tree Heights in an Orchard", ylab="Frequency", xlab="Tree heights (m)", freq=T)
```

6. To print a PDF of this graph we use the __pdf()__ and __dev.off()__ commands
```{r}
pdf("Histogram1.pdf")
hist(Heights,breaks=6, axes=T,col="skyblue4", main="Histogram of Tree Heights in an Orchard", ylab="Frequency", xlab="Tree heights (m)", freq=T)
dev.off()
```
7. Unlike the __barplot()__ command, the histogram plot automates a large amount of the work for us. Nevertheless, it is still possible to override most of these automatic choices by selecting various arguments for the __hist()__ function. 

* Most of these arguments are explained in the __R__ documentation available in the __Help__ panel of the __R Studio__ environment. Just type hist into the the search bar and press enter.  

## Skewed Data and Central Data

A collection of data is __skewed left__ if its histogram displays a tail to the left. This means the at possess __outliers__ at the lower end  of the data set.

### Example: Skewed-left data

```{r}
Left<-c(1,8,8,8,9,9,9,10,10,11,11,11)
hist(Left,col="cornflowerblue",main="Left-Skewed Data", xlab="Left Data Values")
```
* Notice, most of the data is concentrated to the right between 6 and 12. However, a small portion of the data forms a __left-tail__ between 0 and 2. This tail is what skews the data to the left.



Conversely, the data is __skewed right__ if the histogram displays a tail to the right, and likewise this indicates the presence of outlines at the upper end of the data set.

### Example: Right-skewed data
```{r}
Right<-c(1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,12)
hist(Right,breaks=5, col="cornflowerblue",main="Right-Skewed Data", xlab="Right Data Values")
```
* Most of the data is concentrated to the left between 0 and 6. However, a small portion of the data forms a __right-tail__ between 10 and 12. This tail is what skews the data to the right.

### Test for skewness

* If the data is __skewed right__ then
\\[
   mean > median
\\]


* If the data is __skewed left__ then
\\[
  mean < median
\\]

* If the data is __central__ then
\\[
  mean = median
\\]
  and the histogram is symmetric.
  
### Example: Test for skewness
We will test the data sets __Left__ and __Right__ for skewness.

#### Left Data:
```{r}
mean(Left)
```
```{r}
median(Left)
```

* We see that the mean of the __Left__ data is less than the median of the __Left__ data, confirming it is skewed-left.


#### Right Data:
```{r}
mean(Right)
```

```{r}
median(Right)
```

* We see that the mean of the __Right__ data is greater than the median of the __Right__ data, confirming it is skewed-right.


#### Skewness of Heights:

The histogram in __Example 1__ appears to display a tail to the right and so we expect the data to be __skewed right__. 

To test this we can use the __mean()__ and the __median()__ functions and compare.

```{r}
mean(Heights)
median(Heights)
```
Since the mean is bigger than the median, this means the data is __skewed right__ as we expect from the histogram above.

## Example 2
The marks scored by a class in a test are as follows (not in order):

 * 50, 63, 29, 54, 56, 0, 53, 34, 45, 85, 65, 62, 60, 3, 71, 66, 63, 68, 69, 67, 79, 75, 72, 81, 87, 91, 52 

Using this data, answer the following:

A. Use the __sort()__ function to sort this data and the __length()__ function to count the data points

B. Draw a histogram to represent this sorted data

C. From the histogram decide if the data is __skewed left__, __skewed right__ or __symmetric__

D. Find the mean of this data

E. Find the median of this data set

F. Comparing the mean and the median, decide if the data is __skewed left__, __skewed right__ or __symmetric__. Does this agree with the histogram?

### Solution
A.
```{r}
Scores <- c(50, 63, 29, 54, 56, 0, 53, 34, 45, 85, 65, 62, 60, 3, 71, 66, 63, 68, 69, 67, 79, 75, 72, 81, 87, 91, 52)
sort(Scores)
```
```{r}
length(Scores)
```
B.
```{r}
hist(Scores, breaks=8, xlim=c(0,100),ylim=c(0,0.02),freq=F, xlab="Exam Scores", ylab="Relative Frequency", col="darkslategray4", main="Histogram of Exam Scores")
```

C. 
From the histogram, the data appears to be skewed-left.


D.
```{r}
mean(Scores)
```

```{r}
median(Scores)
```
Since the mean is less than the median the data is skewed left. This agrees with the shape of the histogram for the data set.


### Exercise 1

The journey times (in hours) for a train service between two cities were resumed on a given day, with the following data gathered

1.2, 1.22, 1.23, 1.25, 1.3, 1.34, 1.36, 1.39, 1.40, 1.42, 1.45, 1.48, 1.51, 1.56

Given this data, answer the following:

1. Use the __median()__ function to find the median of this data set

2. Use the __mean()__ function

3. Comparing the mean and the median of the data set, is the data skewed-left, skewed-right or central

4. Construct a histogram of this data set

5. Using this histogram, decide if the data is skewed-left, skewed-right or central

6. Does this agree with your answer from part 3?



## Exercise 1 solutions

A.
```{r}
times <-c(1.2, 1.22, 1.23, 1.25, 1.3, 1.34, 1.36, 1.39, 1.40, 1.42, 1.45, 1.48, 1.51, 1.56)

median(times)
```

B.
```{r}
times <-c(1.2, 1.22, 1.23, 1.25, 1.3, 1.34, 1.36, 1.39, 1.40, 1.42, 1.45, 1.48, 1.51, 1.56)

mean(times)
```

C.
From reviewing the median(1.375) and mean(1.365), the data appears to be centralised from the two results.

D.
```{r}
#pdf("histogramTimes.pdf")
times <-c(1.2, 1.22, 1.23, 1.25, 1.3, 1.34, 1.36, 1.39, 1.40, 1.42, 1.45, 1.48, 1.51, 1.56)

hist(times, breaks=4, axes=T,col="deepskyblue", main="histogram of hours/times" ,ylab="frequency", xlab="hours(hrs)", freq=T)

```

E.
From the histogram, the data appears to be skewed to the right.

F.
From the histogram, I'll have to dissagree with the answer from part 3 as being centralised but in fact being skewed right from the diagram.



### Exercise 2

An electrical components manufacturer measures the resistance of a sample of 50 resistors produced during one production run. The resistances were measured as follows

51.20, 50.30, 52.40, 50.24, 51.25, 49.89, 51.63, 52.84, 53.01, 49.99

Given this data, answer the following:

1. Sort the data according to increasing measurements of resistance

2. Use the __median()__ function to find the median of this data set

3. Use the __mean()__ function

4. Comparing the mean and the median of the data set, is the data skewed-left, skewed-right or central

5. Construct a histogram of this data set

6. Using this histogram, decide if the data is skewed-left, skewed-right or central

7. Does this agree with your answer from part 4?

### Exercise 3 
The water quality at a water treatment facility is measured hourly by measuring the impurities present in the water in (measured in parterre-million). The following data was collected during in one 36 hour period:



18, 8, 25, 13, 7, 19

14, 5, 21, 23, 18, 5

# Pareto Charts

A Pareto chart is a combination of a __bar chart__ and a __cumulative frequency chart__

They are a useful diagnostic tool when one wishes to limit various defects, errors, delays, breakdowns in different circumstances.

__Remark:__ To generate Pareto charts we need to import the __qcc__ library as follows

  1. In the __Tools__ tab above, select the option __Install Packages...__
  2. In the __Install from__ option, select __Repository(CRAN, CRANextra)__
  3. In the __Packages__ input line type __qcc__
  4. IN the __Install to Library__ option select your own home directory (this should be the daffodils anyhow)
  5. Make sure __Install all dependencies__ is checked
  
Once installed we call the library __qcc__ as follows
```{r}
library(qcc)
```


### Example 1
 The employees of a company were asked the reasons for late arrivals at work. The data collected were as follows:
 
 * __Child Care__ 22
 
 * __Emergency__ 8
 
 * __Overslept__ 12
 
 * __Public transport__ 15
 
 * __Traffic__ 36
 
 * __Weather__ 27
 
 Using this data answer the following:
 
 1. Create an appropriate vector to represent this data.
 
 2. Use the function __pareto.chart()__ to generate a Pareto chart for this data.
 
 3. From the Pareto chart, determine which causes could reasonable be addressed to reduce late arrivals by at least 35%.
 
1. We first create an appropriate vector of numbers to represent the data, in the usual way:
```{r}
Employees <- c(22,8,12,15,36,27)
Employees
```
Now we create an appropriate vector of names, corresponding the these numbers as follows:
```{r}
Reasons <- c("Child Care", "Emergency", "Overslept", "Public Transport", "Traffic", "Weather")
Reasons
```

* Now we re-create the __Employees__ vector by assigning it the names in the vector __Reasons__ as follows:
```{r}
names(Employees)<-Reasons
```
i.e. each entry has now been given a corresponding name.

* The new __Employees__ vector is 

```{r}
Employees
```
and so we see each number has been assigned a corresponding reason.

2. The __Pareto Chart__ for this data is given by

```{r}
pareto.chart(Employees,col="skyblue2", cumperc=seq(0,100,by=10), main="Pareto chart giving reasons for late arrivals at work")
```

* We notice that the __pareto.chart()__ function plots the frequency of each class, as opposed to the relative frequency of each class. This is easily modified by summing all frequencies in the __Employees__ vector and dividing the the vector by this number to give the __frequency density__ of each class.

```{r}
Total=sum(Employees)
Total
```

```{r}
Employees <- Employees/Total
Employees
```
```{r}
pareto.chart(Employees,col="skyblue2", cumperc=seq(0,100,by=10), ylab="Relative Frequency", main="Pareto chart giving reasons for late arrivals at work")
```


## Exercise 4

A mobile phone repair shop categorized the type of repair work it carried out over a year and found the following data:
  
* __Cracked Screen__ 125
* __Scratched Screen__ 228
* __Forgotten Pass code__ 91
* __Water Damage__ 188
* __Battery Replacement__ 111
* __Software Virus__ 82
* __Phone Bricking__ 188
* __Damaged Connector__ 41
  
Given this data, answer the following:

1. Find the total number of repairs in the year.

2. Construct a vector to represent the relative frequencies of each of these classes.

3. Use this vector of relative frequencies to construct a Pareto chart of this data.

4. From the Pareto chart determine the causes of phone damage owners should address to reduce repairs by at lease 25%.



## Exercise 4 Solutions

A.
```{r}
repairs <-c (125, 228, 91, 188, 111, 82, 188, 41)

sum(c(125, 228, 91, 188, 111, 82, 188, 41))
```

B.
```{r}
Repairs <-c (125, 228, 91, 188, 111, 82, 188, 41)

Reasons <-c ("cracked screen","scratched screen","forgotten passcode","water damage","battery replacement","software virus","phone bricking", "damaged connector")
Reasons
```

```{r}
names(Repairs)<-Reasons
Repairs
```


C.
```{r}
pareto.chart(Repairs,col="skyblue2", cumperc=seq(0,100,by=10), main="Reasons for phone repairs")
```

D.
To avoid risk, dont drop devices into water + do not brick devices.


## Exercise 5

A newly built apartment complex was inspected to prepare a snag list for each apartment. After inspection of apartment the complex, the following issues were found to occur with the frequency indicated:

### List of Damages

Using this data answer the following:

1. Identify the data type given.

2. Construct a vector to represent the frequencies.

3. Using this vector, evaluate the number of damages to be repaired in the apartment complex.

4. Using the vector of frequency values, construct a Pareto chart for this data.

5. From this data determine how which issues should be addressed to ensure at least 75% of damages are repaired.


## Exercise 5 Solutions


A.
Its a listed data type.

B.
```{r}
damagenumbers <-c (4,18,9,51,29,47,14,2,21)

damages <-c ("cooker disconnected","windows not closing","bathroom ventilator broken","damaged plug sockets","broken lights", "damaged paintwork","doors not locking","dampness","scratched flooring")

damages
```

```{r}
names(damagenumbers)<-damages

damagenumbers

```



C.
```{r}
sum(c(4,18,9,51,29,47,14,2,21))
```

D.

```{r}
pareto.chart(damagenumbers,col="firebrick", cumperc=seq(0,100,by=10), main="List of issues in apartment")
```


E.
Damaged plug sockets, damaged paintwork, broken lights and scratched flooring should be avoided to ensure 75% of damages are repaired.
